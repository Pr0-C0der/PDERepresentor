HEAT 2D PDE PROBLEM

PDE:
  ∂u/∂t(x, y, t) = ν [∂²u/∂x²(x, y, t) + ∂²u/∂y²(x, y, t)]

Parameters:
  ν = 0.5 (diffusion coefficient)

Domain:
  Spatial:
    x ∈ [0, 2π]  (periodic boundary conditions in x-direction)
    y ∈ [0, 2π]  (periodic boundary conditions in y-direction)
    Number of grid points: nx = 100, ny = 100
  Time:
    t ∈ [0, 1.0]
    Number of time points: 100

Boundary conditions:
  Periodic in both directions:
    u(0, y, t) = u(2π, y, t)
    u(x, 0, t) = u(x, 2π, t)
    ∂u/∂x(0, y, t) = ∂u/∂x(2π, y, t)
    ∂u/∂y(x, 0, t) = ∂u/∂y(x, 2π, t)
  for all x, y ∈ [0, 2π] and t ∈ [0, 1.0]

Initial condition:
  u(x, y, 0) = sin(x) sin(y)
  for (x, y) ∈ [0, 2π] × [0, 2π]

Notes:
  - This is the 2D heat equation (linear diffusion equation)
  - The solution will decay exponentially in time while maintaining the spatial pattern
  - For the initial condition u(x,y,0) = sin(x) sin(y), the analytic solution is:
    u(x, y, t) = exp(-2νt) sin(x) sin(y)
    because ∂²u/∂x² = -sin(x) sin(y) and ∂²u/∂y² = -sin(x) sin(y),
    so the Laplacian is -2 sin(x) sin(y)
  - The factor of 2 in the decay rate comes from the sum of the two second derivatives
  - With periodic BCs, the solution maintains the separable product form throughout time
  - This is a fundamental test case for 2D diffusion solvers
