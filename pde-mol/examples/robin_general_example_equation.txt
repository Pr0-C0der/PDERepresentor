ROBIN GENERAL EXAMPLE PDE PROBLEM

PDE:
  ∂u/∂t(x, t) = ν ∂²u/∂x²(x, t)

Parameters:
  ν = 0.1 (diffusion coefficient)

Domain:
  Spatial:
    x ∈ [0, 1]
  Time:
    t ∈ [0, 1.0]
    Number of time points: 100

Boundary conditions:
  Left boundary (x = 0):
    General Robin condition: 2*u(0, t) + 3*∂u/∂x(0, t) = 5
    In standard form: a*u + b*u_x = c
    where a = 2.0, b = 3.0, c = 5.0 (constant)
  
  Right boundary (x = 1):
    General Robin condition: 1*u(1, t) + 1*∂u/∂x(1, t) = sin(t)
    In standard form: a*u + b*u_x = c(t)
    where a = 1.0, b = 1.0, c(t) = sin(t) (time-dependent)

Initial condition:
  u(x, 0) = sin(πx)
  for x ∈ [0, 1]

Notes:
  - This example demonstrates the general form of Robin boundary conditions
  - The left boundary uses constant coefficients (a, b, c)
  - The right boundary uses a time-dependent right-hand side (c_expr)
  - Robin boundary conditions are a combination of Dirichlet and Neumann:
    * When b = 0: becomes Dirichlet (u = c/a)
    * When a = 0: becomes Neumann (u_x = c/b)
    * General form: a*u + b*u_x = c allows mixed conditions
  - The left BC: 2*u + 3*u_x = 5 means the boundary value and its derivative
    are coupled, with the derivative weighted more heavily (b=3 > a=2)
  - The right BC: u + u_x = sin(t) creates a time-dependent mixed condition
    that oscillates with time
  - This is useful for modeling problems with:
    * Convective heat/mass transfer at boundaries
    * Radiation boundary conditions
    * Mixed boundary conditions in physical systems
  - The general form is more flexible than the simple form u_x = -h*(u - u_env)
